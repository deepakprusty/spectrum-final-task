DS_ML_Final Task

The world today is data-driven, and the future of data science is growing. Even when you account for the Earth’s entire population, the average person is expected to generate 1.7 megabytes of data per second by the end of 2020, according to cloud vendor Domo.

The scale of big data is truly astounding, and it has already intertwined itself in core aspects of personal and business life. Consumers are becoming more aware of their data privacy rights and data habits, while companies have leveraged such intel to great effect.
A dominant theme today and going forward, big data is poised to play an influential role in the future. Data will define modern health care, government, finance, business management, marketing, energy and manufacturing thereby meeting the challenges of data analytics and help innovate improvements in products, services and society thereby creating Data Science as one of the important features for developing the world. 

Internship Drive 

Some basic concepts of machine learning and data science were learned from various sources starting from the beginner to the advance(pro) level through this spectrum Internship Drive .It also helped to enhance our basic on the following concepts. Here we learnt various concept starting from statistics, linear algebra, datasets,data mining ,visualisation and predicting accuracy too.
1. Task 0:
   From the task 1 usage of differnt packages such as numpy, pandas, etc were learnt. The task that was based on Billy's score and no. of days he studis and grades were given , from there we plotted a scatter plot and analysed it thoroughly using those packages.
2. Task 1:
   The second task was to calculate the final grade of Billy from his annual gradesheet provided and a scatter plot was created from the mean taken from G1 G2 G3 grades of mathematics score. by the help of basics of python, mean was calculated, panda was used to create dataframe of final grade.
3. Final Task:
   In this Task we build a student grade prediction based on the student’s data and previous marks by encoding nominal types of data ( as given in the student.txt file), converting them to numerical form, and then creating a machine learning model to predict the score of a student given his attributes as well as to optimizing the model.By using basic libraries sklearn, numpy pandas statsmodel.api OLS(Ordinary Least Squares).Then based on that eliminating the features and doing so that to achieve the highest accuracy.
